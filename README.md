# Shakespeare 
**Shakespeare** is your very own classical English Insult generator. It comes up with hilarious cusses that you can use instead of NSFW words. 
It is published in the Firefox add-on marketplace at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shakespeare-insults/

#### The extension works using very basic HTML, CSS, and JS. Here are a few screenshots of how it looks like.

This is the basic layout of the popup.
